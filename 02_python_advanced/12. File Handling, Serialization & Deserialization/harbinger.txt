Oh, absolutely. I'm so glad you're telling me this for the hundredth time. I was just thinking to myself, 'I wish I could hear that again.' It's honestly the highlight of my day.
Oh, sure, because that's definitely the most important thing in the world right now. Let's all drop everything and focus on that.
No, really, take your time. I have all the time in the world to listen to this fascinating story.
Wow, you've totally changed my perspective. I mean, who wouldn't want to hear that? I can hardly wait for the sequel.
Oh great, another email about how you've figured out the secret to life. Please, don't hold back, I'm on the edge of my seat.
