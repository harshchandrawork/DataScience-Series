        "## Problem with above code\n",
        "The problem with the above code is that when we try to raise more than one errors at a time, then only the last error is raised and not the earlier one.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason only one error is raised at a time and not the other is that **exceptions in Python are designed to stop the execution of the current block of code** when they are raised. Once an exception is raised, the control flow is immediately transferred to the `except` block (if present) or the program terminates if there is no `except` block to catch it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In your code, you are raising exceptions inside the `validation` method, but once an exception is raised, the method terminates, and the subsequent lines of code (including any other validations) are **never executed**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example of what happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The user is prompted to enter a name and age.\n",
        "2. If the age is below 18, it raises the `InvalidAge` exception.\n",
        "3. As soon as `InvalidAge` is raised, the rest of the validation (such as checking the name) is **not executed** because the exception interrupts the flow.\n",
        "4. If the age is valid but the name is invalid, it raises the `InvalidName` exception, and the rest of the code after it (such as printing \"Validated\") does not run.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solution:\n",
        "If you want to **check all conditions** (for both age and name) and then raise exceptions accordingly, you need to **validate all conditions before raising exceptions**. You can accumulate errors and raise them at the end or after all checks are done.\n",

        "1. **Accumulate errors in a list**: We store the exceptions in the `errors` list instead of raising them immediately.\n",
        "2. **Check all conditions**: We check both age and name conditions, collecting any errors.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Outcome:\n",
        "Now, if both the age and the name are invalid, the program will print both error messages, instead of stopping after raising just one exception.\n",
