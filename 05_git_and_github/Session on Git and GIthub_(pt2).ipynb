    "1. Local repo is created and contains multiple commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. GitHub repo is created manually.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git remote add origin <url>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The first push uploads the entire commit history:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git push origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A new commit is made locally (README).\n",
    "   It is pushed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git push origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A new commit is made **on GitHub** (test.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Local repo pulls it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   git pull origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Local repo now matches the remote repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates real-world team collaboration — where multiple contributors push and pull from a shared central repository."
