    "\n",
    "### **1. What is Git?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** used to track changes in files and manage code.\n",
    "* Created by **Linus Torvalds (2005)** for Linux kernel development.\n",
    "* Key characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Every developer has a **complete local copy** of the repository.\n",
    "  * Very fast operations due to local processing.\n",
    "  * Supports **branching, merging, non-linear development**, and experimentation.\n",
    "  * Ensures strong history tracking and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. How is Git different from GitHub?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Git**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A tool/software.\n",
    "  * Installed on your system.\n",
    "  * Manages version control and history of your files.\n",
    "  * Works even without internet or any online account.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GitHub**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A cloud-based platform.\n",
    "  * Hosts Git repositories online.\n",
    "  * Adds collaboration features: pull requests, issues, code review, project management.\n",
    "  * Acts as a *remote storage + collaboration* layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short**:\n",
    "Git = version control system\n",
    "GitHub = online service built around Git\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What is a Version Control System (VCS)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Version Control System** is a tool that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tracks changes made to files over time.\n",
    "* Stores file history (who changed what & when).\n",
    "* Allows restoring older versions.\n",
    "* Helps teams avoid overwriting each other's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. What is a Source Code Manager (SCM)? Are VCS and SCM the same?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SCM (Source Code Manager)** manages source code changes and keeps track of different versions.\n",
    "* SCM and VCS are generally used as **synonyms**.\n",
    "* Some people consider SCM a broader term, but in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **SCM ≈ VCS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both store code, track versions, and manage revisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. What is MVP? Why is it mentioned in Git context?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MVP = Minimum Viable Product**\n",
    "  A basic version of a product that contains only core features needed to test an idea or gather feedback.\n",
    "* Relevance to Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * While developing MVPs, teams make rapid changes.\n",
    "  * Git helps manage frequent iterations, experimentation, and quick rollbacks.\n",
    "  * Developers can test ideas in separate branches without affecting the main project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Why do we need Git or a VCS?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **History Tracking**\n",
    "   Complete record of all changes made over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recovery from Mistakes**\n",
    "   You can revert to any previous working version.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Safe Experimentation (Branches)**\n",
    "   Try new features without affecting the main code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaboration**\n",
    "   Multiple developers can work together without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Offline Work (Distributed VCS)**\n",
    "   You can commit and work even without internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reduces risk of losing work**\n",
    "   Multiple copies exist due to distributed architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Types of VCS**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Centralized VCS (CVCS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single central server stores the entire code.\n",
    "* Developers check out and commit to **one main repository**.\n",
    "* Pros: simple to understand, easy administration.\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Single Point of Failure** — if server dies, history is lost.\n",
    "  * Need internet to commit or update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: SVN, CVS, Perforce.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Distributed VCS (DVCS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every developer gets a **complete copy** of the repository.\n",
    "* All commits, branches, history exist locally.\n",
    "* Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Faster, safer, works offline.\n",
    "  * No single point of failure.\n",
    "  * Better branching and merging.\n",
    "* Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Slightly more complex for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Git, Mercurial.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **8. Other Version Control Systems (VCS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SVN (Subversion)**\n",
    "* **Mercurial**\n",
    "* **CVS**\n",
    "* **Perforce**\n",
    "* **Bazaar**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Advantages of Git / VCS**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keeps full history\n",
    "* Easy to compare changes\n",
    "* Allows rollback\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Bug Fixing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the exact change where a bug came from\n",
    "* Create bug-fix branches\n",
    "* Test and then merge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Non-Linear Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple branches\n",
    "* Experimental features\n",
    "* Safely merge once complete\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Collaborative Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many people can work at once\n",
    "* Git manages merges and conflicts\n",
    "* Remote repositories allow global teamwork\n",

    "### **10. Scenarios where Git/VCS \"saves the day\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario 1: A major bug breaks the project**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developer accidentally breaks a critical function.\n",
    "* Without Git → panic, difficult to find where it broke.\n",
    "* With Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Go through commit history.\n",
    "  * Identify the commit that introduced the issue.\n",
    "  * Revert or fix the problem in a safe branch.\n",
    "  * Project restored quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario 2: Two developers overwrite each other's work**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Without VCS → files may get overwritten and lost.\n",
    "* With Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each developer works in their own branch.\n",
    "  * Git warns about conflicting changes during merge.\n",
    "  * Conflicts can be resolved with clarity.\n",
    "  * No work is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario 3: Laptop crash / accidental deletion**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In distributed VCS like Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Every developer has a full copy.\n",
    "  * Even if one computer fails, project history is safe.\n",
    "  * Just clone from another copy or remote.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create `app.py`\n",
    "* Add some code to it\n",

    "---\n",

    "Git takes a **snapshot** of your current file state and moves it into the **Staging Area (Index)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that manually adding each file by its name in a large project could be a tedious task. A better alternative would be the **bash** `git add .`, and add the exceptional files to `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Git is preparing this version of the file to be stored permanently.\n",
    "* You can choose which files or changes to stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n",

    "\n",
    "## **What Are Tags?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags in Git are *labels* assigned to specific commits.\n",
    "They help mark important versions of software, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **X (Major Version):**\n",
    "  Indicates large, possibly backward-incompatible changes.\n",

    "* **Y (Minor Version):**\n",
    "  Indicates new features that are backward-compatible.\n",
    "  Example: v1.1.x → v1.2.x.\n",

    "* They allow teams to **easily return** to a particular version.\n",
    "* They ensure **clarity** about what version is deployed or distributed.\n",
    "* They make it easy to **compare different releases**.\n",
    "\n",
