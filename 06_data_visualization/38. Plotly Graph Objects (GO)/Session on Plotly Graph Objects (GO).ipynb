    "## Introduction to Plotly Graph Objects (plotly.go)\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Graph Objects, commonly referred to as **plotly.go**, is the low-level, object-oriented interface of the Plotly visualization library in Python. It allows explicit construction and control of visualizations by defining individual components such as traces, layouts, axes, annotations, and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike high-level interfaces, plotly.go exposes the full Plotly figure schema, making it suitable for complex, highly customized, and production-oriented visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Position of plotly.go in the Plotly Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly provides multiple abstraction layers for data visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **plotly.express (px)**: High-level interface designed for simplicity and speed\n",
    "* **plotly.graph_objects (go)**: Low-level interface designed for precision and control\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, visualizations have been created using **plotly.express**, which internally generates figures composed of graph objects. Learning plotly.go means working directly with these underlying objects rather than relying on automated defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison: Plotly Express vs Plotly Graph Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Express**\n",
    "  A high-level API that abstracts away most configuration details, enabling rapid visualization with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Graph Objects**\n",
    "  A low-level API where each component of the figure is explicitly defined, offering complete control.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Structure and Style\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Express**\n",
    "  Declarative and concise, well-suited for exploratory data analysis and quick insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Graph Objects**\n",
    "  Object-oriented and more verbose, suitable for complex visualizations and application-level usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customization Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Express**\n",
    "  Limited to predefined parameters. Advanced customization often requires transitioning to graph objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Graph Objects**\n",
    "  Near-unlimited customization, including detailed styling, layout control, and interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Express**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "  * Rapid prototyping\n",
    "  * Learning and academic use\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plotly Graph Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Enterprise dashboards\n",
    "  * Research and publication-grade visuals\n",
    "  * Visualization components in applications\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship Between plotly.express and plotly.go\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Express is built on top of Plotly Graph Objects. Every figure created using plotly.express ultimately results in a `go.Figure` object containing one or more trace objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* plotly.express simplifies figure creation\n",
    "* plotly.go provides direct access to the underlying figure structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding plotly.go enables developers to modify, extend, and fine-tune figures initially created using plotly.express.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## plotly.go and Live Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Graph Objects **do not directly support live or continuously updating data sources**. Once rendered, the figure remains static unless explicitly re-rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For use cases involving:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-time data updates\n",
    "* Interactive callbacks\n",
    "* Dynamic user-driven behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "a separate framework is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Dash and Its Dependency on plotly.go\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dash** is a Python framework used to build interactive and real-time analytical web applications. It is built on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plotly for visualizations\n",
    "* Flask for backend logic\n",
    "* React.js for frontend rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash applications operate directly on **Plotly Graph Objects**, making prior knowledge of plotly.go essential. Therefore, learning plotly.go is a prerequisite before moving on to Dash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Learning Progression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use plotly.express for quick and efficient visualizations\n",
    "2. Learn plotly.graph_objects for full control and customization\n",
    "3. Advance to Dash for building interactive and live dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "This progression aligns well with industry practices and is particularly relevant for data science, analytics engineering, and applied research roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* plotly.go is the core, low-level API of the Plotly visualization library\n",
    "* It offers precise control over figure construction and styling\n",
    "* plotly.express is a higher-level wrapper built on top of plotly.go\n",
    "* plotly.go alone does not handle live data sources\n",
    "* Dash extends plotly.go to enable interactive and real-time applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering plotly.go bridges the gap between exploratory visualization and production-grade analytical systems."

    "## Bubble Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bubble plot** is an extension of the **scatter plot**. Similar to a scatter plot, data points are positioned using two continuous variables on the **x-axis** and **y-axis**. The key distinction is that a bubble plot incorporates **marker size** to represent an additional numerical variable, thereby adding another visual dimension to the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markers belonging to the same group can share the same color (as in a standard scatter plot), while the **size of each marker varies based on a third factor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensional Representation in a Bubble Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, a bubble plot can visually encode **four different variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **X-axis** → First numerical variable\n",
    "2. **Y-axis** → Second numerical variable\n",
    "3. **Marker (bubble) size** → Third numerical variable\n",
    "4. **Marker color** → Group or categorical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes bubble plots particularly useful when analyzing **multi-dimensional relationships** in a compact visual form.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Bubble Plot Using plotly.go\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **X-axis** represents batting average\n",
    "* **Y-axis** represents strike rate\n",
    "* **Bubble size** represents the number of sixes hit\n",
    "* **Hover text** displays detailed contextual information for each batsman\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_ipl = new_ipl[new_ipl['batsman_runs'] == 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "six = new_ipl.groupby('batsman')['batsman_runs'].count().reset_index()\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation and Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Larger bubbles indicate batsmen who hit more sixes\n",
    "* Position on the plot shows the trade-off between average and strike rate\n",
    "* Hover information enhances interpretability without cluttering the chart\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bubble plots extend scatter plots by introducing variable marker sizes\n",
    "* They allow visualization of up to four dimensions of data simultaneously\n",
    "* Marker size encodes a numerical variable, while color can encode grouping\n",
    "* Bubble plots are effective for exploratory analysis of multi-dimensional datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "When used judiciously, bubble plots provide a powerful way to uncover patterns that are not visible in two-dimensional visualizations."

    "## Distplot (Distribution Plot)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **distribution plot (distplot)** is used to visualize the distribution of a **single continuous variable**. In Plotly, a distplot is a **composite visualization** that overlays three different plots on the same axes to provide both statistical and visual insight into the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three components of a distplot are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Histogram**\n",
    "2. **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) Plot**\n",
    "3. **Rug Plot**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component contributes a different perspective on how the data is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a Distplot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "* Displays the **frequency distribution** of the data\n",
    "* The x-axis is divided into bins (intervals)\n",
    "* The height of each bar represents the number of observations within that interval\n",
    "* Provides a coarse but intuitive view of the data shape\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "* A smooth, continuous curve that represents the **probability density function** of the data\n",
    "* Eliminates the discontinuities introduced by histogram bins\n",
    "* Helps identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Distribution shape\n",
    "  * Peaks (modes)\n",
    "  * Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "The KDE plot is particularly useful for comparing distributions visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rug Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "* A rug plot places **small tick marks** (usually along the x-axis) at the position of each data point\n",
    "* Each tick represents a single observation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Rug Plots Are Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reveal the **exact location of individual data points**\n",
    "* Help identify **clustering** and **gaps** in the data\n",
    "* Provide transparency about data density without aggregating values\n",
    "\n",
    "Rug plots are especially helpful when the dataset is small to medium in size, as they expose the raw data underlying the histogram and KDE curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distplot Example Using Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# plot distplot\n",
    "\n",
    "import plotly.figure_factory as ff\n",
    "\n",
    "hist_data = [avg['avg'], avg['batsman_runs']]\n",
    "group_labels = ['Average', 'Strike Rate']\n",
    "\n",
    "fig = ff.create_distplot(hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[10, 20])\n",
    "\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "# pyo.plot(fig)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple distributions are plotted together\n",
    "* Each variable has its own histogram, KDE curve, and rug plot\n",
    "* Bin sizes are customized separately for better representation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "A **histogram** is a statistical plot used to discover and visualize the **underlying frequency distribution (shape)** of a set of continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How a Histogram Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The range of the data is divided into **bins (intervals)**\n",
    "2. Each observation is assigned to a bin\n",
    "3. The height of each bar represents the **count of observations** within that bin\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms help answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where is the data concentrated?\n",
    "* Is the distribution symmetric or skewed?\n",
    "* Are there multiple peaks?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram Example Using plotly.go\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# plot histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "trace = go.Histogram(\n",
    "    x=sr['batsman_runs'],\n",
    "    name='Strike Rate Variations',\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bin Size Customization Using `xbins`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `xbins` parameter controls how the data is divided along the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A bin size of **2** is used\n",
    "* Smaller bin sizes increase **granularity and accuracy**\n",
    "* Larger bin sizes reduce noise but may hide details\n",
    "\n",
    "To further control the histogram range, additional arguments can be provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xbins={'size': 2, 'start': 50, 'end': 100}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `xbins` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **size**: Width of each bin\n",
    "* **start**: Lower bound of the histogram\n",
    "* **end**: Upper bound of the histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows precise control over readability and focus on specific value ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distplots visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using multiple layered plots\n",
    "* Histograms show frequency distribution\n",
    "* KDE plots provide a smooth density estimate\n",
    "* Rug plots expose individual data points\n",
    "* Histograms rely heavily on bin size selection\n",
    "* `xbins` allows control over bin width and range\n",
    "\n",
    "Distplots and histograms together provide both aggregated and granular insight into data distribution, making them essential tools in exploratory data analysis."

    "## Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "A **heatmap** is a graphical representation of data in which the individual values of a matrix are represented using **colors**. Heatmaps are particularly effective for identifying patterns, intensities, and concentrations across two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a heatmap, **three pieces of information are represented simultaneously**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **X-axis** → First categorical or numerical variable\n",
    "2. **Y-axis** → Second categorical or numerical variable\n",
    "3. **Color intensity (hue / saturation / gradient)** → Magnitude of the third numerical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes heatmaps suitable for multi-dimensional pattern analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Heatmap Using plotly.go\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the heatmap visualizes the **number of sixes hit per over by each batting team**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "six = delivery[delivery['batsman_runs'] == 6]\n",
    "six = six.groupby(['batting_team', 'over'])['batsman_runs'].count().reset_index()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only deliveries where **six runs** were scored are selected\n",
    "* Data is grouped by `batting_team` and `over`\n",
    "* The count represents the frequency of sixes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    x=six['batting_team'],\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why the `tools` Module Is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "To place multiple heatmaps **side by side within the same figure**, subplot functionality is required. Plotly provides this through the `tools` module.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the `tools` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables creation of **complex figure layouts**\n",
    "* Allows multiple plots in a single figure using subplots\n",
    "* Supports shared axes, titles, and layout alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, `tools` was not required because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All earlier visualizations contained **only a single plot per figure**\n",
    "* `go.Figure()` was sufficient for simple layouts\n",

    "## Facet Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A **facet plot** refers to a visualization technique where multiple plots of the **same type** are displayed within a single figure, split across the values of one or more categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facet plots are especially useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comparing distributions across categories\n",
    "* Observing patterns across groups\n",
    "* Identifying segment-wise trends\n",
    "* Maintaining consistency in chart type while varying subsets of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Facet plotting is natively supported in Plotly Express.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Scatter Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we use the built-in **tips dataset** provided by Plotly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "px.scatter(tips, x='total_bill', y='tip')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a single scatter plot showing the relationship between:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `total_bill`\n",
    "* `tip`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Facets Using `facet_col`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we want separate scatter plots for different values in the `sex` column (Male and Female), but within the same figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# facet plot on 'sex' col\n",
    "px.scatter(tips, x='total_bill', y='tip', facet_col='sex')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens here?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset is split by unique values in `sex`\n",
    "* A separate scatter plot is created for each value\n",
    "* Plots are arranged horizontally\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables direct comparison between Male and Female tipping behavior.\n",

    "## Creating Facet Rows Using `facet_row`\n",
    "\n",
    "Facet plots can also be arranged vertically using `facet_row`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a grid of plots split by two categorical variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# facet plot on 'smoker' col and 'sex' row\n",
    "px.scatter(tips, x='total_bill', y='tip', facet_col='smoker', facet_row='sex')\n",

    "|        | Smoker: Yes | Smoker: No |\n",
    "| ------ | ----------- | ---------- |\n",
    "| Male   | Scatter     | Scatter    |\n",
    "| Female | Scatter     | Scatter    |\n",

    "Key idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `facet_col` → Horizontal alignment\n",
    "* `facet_row` → Vertical alignment\n",
    "* Using both → Creates a grid\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controlling Layout with `facet_col_wrap`\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are many unique values in a column (for example, `year` in the Gapminder dataset), placing all plots in one row can make the figure too wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where `facet_col_wrap` becomes useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "px.scatter(\n",

    "    facet_col_spacing=0.05\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does this do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `facet_col='year'` → Creates one plot per year\n",
    "* `facet_col_wrap=3` → Maximum of 3 plots per row\n",
    "* Remaining plots wrap to the next line\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a clean multi-row grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spacing Between Facets\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `facet_col_spacing`\n",
    "* `facet_row_spacing`\n",
    "\n",
    "They control spacing between columns and rows respectively.\n",
