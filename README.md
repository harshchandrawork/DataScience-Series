# 📘 Data Science Lesson Notes & Solutions

Welcome to my Data Science learning journey! 🚀  
This repository contains my **daily lesson notes**, **task solutions**, and **supporting files** as I study Data Science through structured lessons and exercises.

## 📂 Structure
```

├── 📄 README.md                ← Main landing document
├── 📄 LICENSE                  ← Choose a license (e.g., MIT)
│
├── 📁 Lesson-01/
│   ├── 📝 Notes.md             ← Notes from Lesson 01
│   ├── 📝 Solution.md          ← Solution to task from Lesson 01
│   └── 📄 dataset.csv          ← Any required files (e.g., datasets, images, notebooks)

│
├── 📁 Lesson-03/
│   ├── 📝 Notes.md
│   ├── 📝 Solution.md
│   └── 📄 report.pdf
│
└── ... and so on
```

Each Lesson has its own folder:
- `Lesson-01/Notes.md` → Key takeaways and concepts from the Lesson
- `Lesson-01/Solution.md` → Task or assignment solution related to the Lesson
- Other files (e.g., datasets, images, code) are stored as needed

## 📈 Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Stay consistent in my learning journey
- Make my progress visible to hiring professionals
- Create a structured portfolio showcasing my learning style and discipline

## 🚀 How to Use

Feel free to browse through the lecture folders to see how I approached each topic. If you’re also learning Data Science, this might help you too!
