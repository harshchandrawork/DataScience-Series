# 📘 Data Science Lesson Notes & Solutions

Welcome to my Data Science learning journey! 🚀  
This repository contains my **daily lesson notes**, **task solutions**, and **supporting files** as I study Data Science through structured lessons and exercises.

Each Lesson has its own folder:
- `Lesson-01/Notes.md` → Key takeaways and concepts from the Lesson
- `Lesson-01/Solution.md` → Task or assignment solution related to the Lesson
- Other files (e.g., datasets, images, code) are stored as needed

## 📈 Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Stay consistent in my learning journey
- Make my progress visible to hiring professionals
- Create a structured portfolio showcasing my learning style and discipline
