    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**  \n",
    "Aliasing refers to the situation where **two or more variables refer to the same memory location (object) in Python**. This means that modifying the object through one variable will reflect in the other variable as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Memory Storage in Python**  \n",
    "When a program runs, all variables are stored in **RAM (Random Access Memory)**. RAM contains registers where:  \n",
    "1. The **binary representation of the value** held by a variable is stored.  \n",
    "2. The **memory address of each object** is assigned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each object in Python has a unique memory address, which can be retrieved using the `id()` function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Aliasing in Action**\n",
    "When you assign one variable to another in Python, both variables point to the **same object in memory**, leading to aliasing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of Aliasing**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]  # 'a' refers to a list object\n",
    "b = a          # 'b' is now an alias for 'a'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a is b)  # True (both refer to the same object)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, both `a` and `b` point to the **same list object** in memory.  \n",

    "#### **Effect of Aliasing**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "b.append(4)  \n",
    "print(a)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (Modification reflects in 'a' as well)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since `a` and `b` are aliases (refer to the same memory location), modifying `b` also modifies `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Avoid Aliasing?**  \n",
    "To create a copy of an object **without aliasing**, use:  \n",

    "Unlike lower-level languages like **C or C++**, Python **does not allow direct memory management** by the user. Instead, it relies on an **automatic memory management system**, which includes:  \n",

    "Python keeps track of how many references (variables or data structures) point to an object in memory using **reference counting**.  \n",
    "- When an object’s reference count drops to **zero**, Python **automatically deletes** the object.  \n",

    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",

    "b.next = a  # 'b' references 'a' (circular reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "del a, b  # Objects are not deleted immediately due to circular reference\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python’s **garbage collector** detects and collects such cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Python’s Generational Garbage Collector**\n",
    "Python’s **gc module** manages memory using a **three-generation system**, where objects are grouped into **three generations (0, 1, and 2)**.  \n",
    "- **New objects** start in **Generation 0**.  \n",
    "- **Surviving objects** move to **higher generations** (1 and 2).  \n",
    "- **Older objects** are collected **less frequently** to optimize performance.\n",

    "##### **Manually Controlling Garbage Collection**\n",
    "Python allows **manual garbage collection** using the `gc` module.\n",

    "- **Aliasing Issues:** Two variables referencing the same mutable object will reflect changes made by either.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  b = a  # Both variables refer to the same list in memory\n",
    "  b.append(4)\n",
    "  print(a)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (unexpected change!)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Thread Safety Concerns:** Shared mutable objects can cause race conditions in multi-threaded programs if modified without synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**  \n",
    "The **key distinction** between mutable and immutable objects is that mutable objects can change their contents while **retaining the same memory address**, whereas immutable objects **always create a new object on modification**. Understanding this helps prevent unintended side effects, aliasing issues, and improves code reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Are Immutable Objects Called \"Immutable\" Even If They Can Be Modified?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, immutability seems contradictory because some immutable objects, like `tuple`, appear to be modified when we perform operations on them. However, this is a **misconception**—the object itself is **not modified**, rather a **new object is created**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example: Tuple Modification**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "T = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(id(T))  # Memory address before modification\n",
    "\n",
    "T = T + (4,)  # Concatenation creates a NEW tuple\n",
    "print(T)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "print(id(T))  # New memory address (different from the original)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation:**  \n",
    "1. Initially, `T` points to a tuple `(1, 2, 3)`.  \n",
    "2. When `T + (4,)` is executed, **a new tuple** `(1, 2, 3, 4)` is created in memory.  \n",
    "3. The variable `T` is **reassigned** to reference this new tuple.  \n",
    "4. The **original tuple remains unchanged**, confirming its immutability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways About Immutability**  \n",
    "1. **Immutable objects cannot be changed in-place.**  \n",
    "   - Any operation that seems to modify them actually creates a new object.  \n",
    "2. **Rebinding a variable does not change the original object.**  \n",
    "   - The variable simply starts referencing a new object.  \n",
    "3. **Mutability vs. Reassignment:**  \n",

    "In Python, a **list is based on two major concepts**:  \n",
    "1. **Referential Array** → Stores references (addresses) instead of actual objects.  \n",
    "2. **Dynamic Array** → Can grow/shrink dynamically, unlike static arrays in C/C++.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📌 List in Python Works on Two Major Concepts:**\n",
    "#### **1️⃣ Referential Array**\n",
    "- A list in Python is **not** a contiguous block of memory (unlike C arrays).  \n",
    "- It stores **references** (pointers) to objects rather than storing the actual values.\n",
    "- This allows **lists to store mixed data types** efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2️⃣ Dynamic Array**\n",
    "- Python lists are implemented as **dynamic arrays**, meaning they **automatically expand** when needed.\n",
    "- Internally, when a list grows beyond its capacity, Python:\n",
    "  - Allocates a new, larger memory block.\n",
    "  - Copies existing references into the new block.\n",
    "  - Frees the old block.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🛠️ How Nested Lists Are Stored in Memory? (Visualization)**  \n",
    "Consider a **2D list** in Python:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### **🔹 Step 1: Outer List Stores References**\n",
    "The outer list **does not store numbers directly**. Instead, it stores **references (memory addresses) to the inner lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable       | Memory Address | Stored Value |\n",
    "|---------------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| `nested_list`  | `0x100`        | `[0x200, 0x300, 0x400]` |\n",
    "| `nested_list[0]` | `0x200`        | `[1, 2, 3]` |\n",
    "| `nested_list[1]` | `0x300`        | `[4, 5, 6]` |\n",
    "| `nested_list[2]` | `0x400`        | `[7, 8, 9]` |\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Key Observation:**  \n",
    "- The **outer list (`nested_list`) stores only references**, not actual values.  \n",
    "- The **inner lists** (`[1,2,3]`, `[4,5,6]`, `[7,8,9]`) are **separate objects in memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🔹 Step 2: Visualizing Memory Storage**\n",
    "📍 **Memory Representation of `nested_list`**  \n",
    "```\n",
    "nested_list (0x100)\n",
    "│\n",
    "├──► [0x200] ───► [1, 2, 3]  \n",

    "├──► [0x300] ───► [4, 5, 6]  \n",

    "└──► [0x400] ───► [7, 8, 9]  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Each **inner list** has its own memory address, and the outer list simply stores **references** to these lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🔹 Step 3: Why Does Python Use This Complex Storage?**\n",
    "1. **Efficient Memory Usage**  \n",
    "   - Instead of storing large objects repeatedly, Python **stores references**.\n",
    "   - If multiple lists contain the same object, they **share the reference** rather than creating duplicate copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Supports Mixed Data Types**  \n",
    "   - Since lists store references, Python allows a mix of **integers, floats, strings, and even objects** inside a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prevents Redundant Copies**  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "   y = [x, x]  # Both elements refer to the same list 'x'\n",
    "   print(y[0] is y[1])  # True (Both point to same memory address)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The **same object** is referenced multiple times instead of being duplicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📌 How Python Accesses Nested List Elements?**\n",
    "To access an element, Python performs **dereferencing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(nested_list[1][2])  # Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "📝 **Step-by-step memory access**:\n",
    "1. `nested_list[1]` → Retrieves reference `0x300` → Points to `[4, 5, 6]`.\n",
    "2. `nested_list[1][2]` → Accesses index `2` → Retrieves value `6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔄 How Can This Cause Problems?**\n",
    "Since **lists store references**, modifying an inner list **modifies all references** pointing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n",
    "copy_list = nested_list  # Copies reference, NOT values\n",
    "\n",
    "copy_list[0][0] = 100  # Modifies the inner list\n",
    "print(nested_list)  # [[100, 2], [3, 4]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ **Solution:** Use `copy.deepcopy()` for a true copy.\n",
