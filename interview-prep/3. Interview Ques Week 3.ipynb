    "## 🔹 **How Indexing Works in Sets? Understanding Hashing**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python sets **do not support traditional indexing** like lists or tuples because they rely on **hashing** to store elements. This makes sets **unordered and unindexed**, meaning elements are not stored in a predictable order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Why Do Sets Use Hashing?**  \n",
    "🔹 Unlike lists and tuples, which use **sequential memory storage**, sets rely on **hashing** for:  \n",
    "✔ **Faster lookups** (`O(1)` time complexity for searching).  \n",
    "✔ **Efficient insertion and deletion** (`O(1)` on average).  \n",
    "✔ **No duplicate elements** (hashing ensures uniqueness).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠ **Since sets use hashing, their order may change every time a program runs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Understanding Hashing**\n",
    "🔹 Hashing is a process that **maps data to a fixed-size memory location** using a **hash function**.  \n",
    "✔ A **hash function** takes an input (element) and produces a **unique index (hash value)**.  \n",
    "✔ This hash value determines where the element is stored in **hash tables**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🔹 Example: Simple Hashing Function**  \n",
    "Let’s consider a **hash function**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{hash(value)} = value \\mod 5\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "This function maps an element to an index between **0 and 4**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **🔹 How elements are stored using hashing?**\n",
    "| Element | Hash Calculation (`value % 5`) | Stored at Index |\n",
    "|---------|------------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| 12 | `12 % 5 = 2` | Index `2` |\n",
    "| 25 | `25 % 5 = 0` | Index `0` |\n",
    "| 19 | `19 % 5 = 4` | Index `4` |\n",
    "| 32 | `32 % 5 = 2` | **Collision at Index `2`** |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Collision Handling in Sets**\n",
    "When two elements **produce the same hash value**, a **collision** occurs.  \n",
    "Python uses **chaining (linked lists)** and **open addressing (probing)** to handle this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🔹 1️⃣ Chaining (Linked List Approach)**\n",
    "When a collision occurs, elements are stored **as linked lists** at the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Example:**  \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\text{Index} & \\text{Stored Values} \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "0 & 25 \\\\\n",
    "1 & - \\\\\n",
    "2 & \\mathbf{12 \\rightarrow 32} \\text{ (Chained)} \\\\\n",
    "3 & - \\\\\n",
    "4 & 19 \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Advantage:** Can store multiple elements at the same index.  \n",
    "🔹 **Disadvantage:** **Slower lookups** (`O(k)`, where `k` is the length of the chain).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🔹 2️⃣ Open Addressing (Probing)**\n",
    "Instead of chaining, probing **finds an alternative empty slot** to store the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **🔹 Example of Linear Probing**\n",
    "If `32` collides at **index 2**, try **index 3, then 4, etc.**, until an empty slot is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Attempt | Index |\n",
    "|---------|------|\n",
    "| `hash(32) = 2` (Collision) | ❌ 2 (Occupied) |\n",
    "| Try next index (Linear Probing) | ✅ 3 (Empty) |\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **New Table After Linear Probing:**\n",

    "4 & 19 \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Advantage:** Faster retrieval in some cases.  \n",
    "🔹 **Disadvantage:** Can lead to **clustering** (elements grouped together).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Other Probing Methods:** Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Heterogeneous Data in Sets**\n",
    "Python **supports heterogeneous data types** in sets, meaning a set can contain **integers, strings, floats, etc.**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Example:**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_set = {10, \"apple\", 5.5, (1, 2)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "🔹 Python ensures **hash functions work across different data types** by **converting** each element to a **unique hashable form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Hashing in action:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(hash(10))        # Hash value for an integer\n",
    "print(hash(\"apple\"))   # Hash value for a string\n",
    "print(hash(5.5))       # Hash value for a float\n",
    "print(hash((1, 2)))    # Hash value for a tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠ **Lists, dictionaries, and sets are unhashable** because they are **mutable**.\n",

    "## 🔹 **Why Dictionary Keys Cannot Be of Mutable Data Types?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **dictionary keys must be immutable** because they are **hashed** using a **hash function** to determine their storage location. If a mutable object were allowed as a key, it could lead to **unexpected behavior and errors**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 The Role of Hashing in Dictionary Keys**  \n",
    "Python dictionaries use **hash tables**, which rely on a **hash function** to store key-value pairs efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **How it works:**  \n",
    "- The key is passed through a **hash function** to compute a **unique hash value**.  \n",
    "- This **hash value** determines where the key-value pair is stored in memory.  \n",
    "- When retrieving a value, Python re-hashes the key to find its location quickly (`O(1)` lookup time).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔹 **Immutable objects (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples) are hashable** and produce a **consistent hash value**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 What Happens If a Mutable Object is Used as a Key?**  \n",
    "Mutable objects (like **lists, sets, or dictionaries**) **can change after creation**. If a dictionary key were mutable:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ **Hash Value Instability:**  \n",
    "   - Since hashing is based on the key’s content, changing a mutable key **would change its hash value**.  \n",
    "   - The dictionary would **lose track** of where the value was stored, leading to retrieval failures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **Data Corruption Risk:**  \n",
    "   - A dictionary relies on **fixed hash values** for keys. If a key changes, Python **wouldn’t be able to locate the value** stored under the original hash.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ **Duplicate Key Issue:**  \n",
    "   - Dictionaries enforce **unique keys**.  \n",
    "   - If a key could be modified, multiple different-looking keys might **hash to the same value**, breaking dictionary integrity.  \n",

    "### **🔹 Example: Using a Mutable Key (Fails)**  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = { [1, 2, 3]: \"value\" }  # ❌ TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "```\n",
    "🔹 **Why does this fail?**  \n",
    "- Lists are **mutable**, meaning their content can change.  \n",
    "- Python prevents this to ensure **dictionary integrity**.  \n",

    "print(my_dict[(1, 2, 3)])  # Output: value\n",
    "```\n",
    "✔ **Tuples are immutable**, so their hash value **remains the same**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠ Exception:** If a **tuple contains mutable elements**, it becomes **unhashable**:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_dict = { (1, 2, [3, 4]): \"value\" }  # ❌ TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "✔ **Reason:** The list `[3, 4]` inside the tuple is **mutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Ensuring Uniqueness and Efficient Lookup**  \n",
    "✔ Dictionaries use **hashing to prevent duplicate keys**.  \n",
    "✔ If mutable objects were allowed, different-looking keys **might hash to the same location** after modification.  \n",

    "✅ **Mutable objects (lists, sets, dictionaries) cannot be keys** as they can change after creation.  \n",
    "✅ **Changing a mutable key would break hash consistency**, making dictionary lookups unreliable.  \n",

    "- Implement `__hash__()` method, which returns a unique integer for the object.\n",
    "- Implement `__eq__()` to ensure equality comparison.\n",
    "- Have a hash value that does not change over time (i.e., its attributes must be immutable).  \n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_set = { (1, 2, 3) }  # ✅ Works fine\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Lists are mutable, so they **don’t have a `__hash__()` method** and can’t be stored in sets. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable and can be hashed.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔸 2. What is `__hash__()` and How Does It Work?**\n",
    "The `__hash__()` method is used by Python to generate a unique identifier (integer) for objects stored in hash-based collections like **sets** and **dictionaries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example of Hashable Object (Custom Class with `__hash__`)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __hash__(self):\n",
    "        return hash((self.brand, self.model))  # Hashing immutable tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(hash(car1))  # Example: 872648392\n",
    "print(hash(car2))  # Example: 872648392\n",
    "```\n",
    "✔ **Why does this work?**  \n",
    "- `__hash__()` returns an integer computed using the **immutable tuple `(brand, model)`**.\n",
    "- Since tuples are immutable, their hash values **remain constant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔸 3. Why Does `hash()` Return an Integer?**\n",
    "When you call `hash(obj)`, Python generates a **unique integer** for the object based on its contents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example: Hashing Different Data Types**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(hash(10))         # ✅ Works: Hashes an integer\n",
    "print(hash(\"Python\"))   # ✅ Works: Hashes a string\n",
    "print(hash((1, 2, 3)))  # ✅ Works: Hashes a tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "✔ The hash function produces **fixed-length integers** that allow **quick lookups** in sets and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Rule:** If two objects are **equal (`__eq__` returns `True`)**, their hash values **must also be equal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔸 4. Why Can Some Mutable Objects Be Stored in Sets?**\n",
    "📌 **Custom Mutable Objects Can Be Hashable!**  \n",
    "Even though **mutable objects like class instances** can change over time, they **can still be hashable** if they:  \n",
    "1. **Implement `__hash__()` correctly** and ensure the hash value doesn't change.  \n",
    "2. **Override `__eq__()`** so objects with the same attributes are considered equal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Example: A Hashable Mutable Object**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __hash__(self):\n",
    "        return hash(self.name)  # Only hashing immutable name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "        return self.name == other.name\n",

    "p1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "p2 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(hash(p1))  # Same hash for both because only `name` is used\n",
    "print(hash(p2))\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {p1, p2}  # ✅ Works fine because they have the same hash!\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Only one entry because they're considered equal\n",
    "```\n",
    "✔ Since **only the name is hashed**, even though `age` changes, the object is **still hashable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔸 5. What Happens if `__hash__()` is Not Defined?**\n",
    "If an object **does not implement `__hash__()`**, Python checks if it’s **mutable**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable objects** (like `int`, `str`, `tuple`) **have a default `__hash__()`** method.\n",
    "- **Mutable objects** (like `list`, `dict`) **are unhashable** by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example: Making a List Hashable (Bad Practice)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",

    "        return hash(tuple(self.data))  # Convert list to immutable tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "c1 = CustomList([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "print(hash(c1))  # ✅ Works, but risky if list changes later\n",
    "```\n",
    "🚨 **Warning!** If `self.data` changes, the object’s hash becomes invalid!\n",

    "### **🔸 6. Why Not Just Store Objects in Lists Instead of Sets?**\n",
    "If lists can store all types of objects, why do we need sets with hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Efficiency**:  \n",
    "- **Sets use hashing**, so checking for duplicates is **O(1)** (very fast).  \n",
    "- **Lists use iteration**, so checking for duplicates is **O(n)** (slower).  \n",

    "✔ **Example: Searching in a Set vs. List**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "big_list = [i for i in range(100000)]\n",
    "big_set = set(big_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(99999 in big_list)  # ❌ Slow: O(n) search\n",
    "print(99999 in big_set)   # ✅ Fast: O(1) search\n",
