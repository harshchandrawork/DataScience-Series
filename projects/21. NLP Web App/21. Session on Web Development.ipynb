    "## 🧪 What is Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a **lightweight web framework** written in Python. It is used to build web applications and APIs with minimal overhead, allowing you to plug in features as needed. Flask follows the **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and the **Werkzeug** toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is known as a \"**micro-framework**\" because it doesn't come with built-in tools like form validation or database abstraction (though these can be added via extensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Uses of Flask in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is **not a data science tool by itself**, but it plays a key role in **deploying** and **sharing data science models and insights**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Model Deployment**\n",
    "- Flask allows you to **serve machine learning or deep learning models** as REST APIs.\n",
    "- Once a model is trained (e.g., with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), Flask can be used to expose the model to other systems or applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    data = request.json\n",
    "    prediction = model.predict([data['features']])\n",
    "    return jsonify(prediction.tolist())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Interactive Dashboards**\n",
    "- Used to integrate with front-end libraries (or with Dash/Plotly) to build **interactive dashboards** that visualize data in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Data Collection & Input Forms**\n",
    "- Flask enables building simple web forms to **collect user data** or **take inputs** for models (e.g., house price prediction inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Creating APIs for Automation**\n",
    "- Automating repetitive data science tasks such as:\n",
    "  - Preprocessing pipelines\n",
    "  - Scheduled batch predictions\n",
    "  - Logging and monitoring of model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Embedding Notebooks or Reports**\n",
    "- Flask can render HTML templates that embed:\n",
    "  - Matplotlib visualizations\n",
    "  - Pandas DataFrames (as tables)\n",
    "  - Jupyter notebook outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Why Data Scientists Should Learn Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists often need to **present their work to non-technical users or integrate it into real-world systems**. Knowing how to use Flask to wrap a model into a web service makes you more versatile and production-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👉 Expected Level of Flask Knowledge for a Data Scientist:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Skill | Description |\n",
    "|-------|-------------|\n",
    "| ✅ **Basic** | Understand Flask routing, templates, API creation |\n",
    "| ✅ **Intermediate** | Build model-serving APIs using `joblib`, `pickle`, or deep learning models |\n",
    "| ✅ **File Handling** | Handle image, CSV uploads or form inputs |\n",
    "| ✅ **Testing & Debugging** | Handle basic errors and logging |\n",
    "| ✅ **Deployment Ready** | Use Flask + Gunicorn + Docker for simple deployment (optional but useful) |\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 You **don’t** need to be a full-stack web developer, but you **should** know enough Flask to:\n",
    "- Build a REST API for your ML model\n",
    "- Deploy a basic data app\n",
    "- Communicate with front-end developers effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Common Flask Tools/Data Science Libraries\n",
    "- `joblib`, `pickle` (for model loading)\n",
    "- `requests`, `jsonify` (for API I/O)\n",
    "- `Flask-CORS` (for cross-origin API access)\n",

    "## Starting with the Development\n",
    "For this project, we will be starting with several basic steps, since we are a beginner with Flask at this stage. So here are the steps as I progress towards the end of the project, and this text will work as a log of my activities, explaining and keeping track of all the stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialising app.py\n",
    "This is going to be the server file of our project. This file contains all the routes of our project. Here is how I initialise this file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return render_template(\"login.html\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Importing `Flask` and the `render_template` function from **Flask**. Then, assigning the file's name to the variable '*app*'.\n",
    "> This is done so that the file's name shall be declared and used as an object, upon which the functions, such as `.route` shall be called upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we create the index function, that is called upon the route *'/'*, that is the default page. The index function renders the html page, by returning the render_template function with the html page's address and name as parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialising the Templates\n",
    "We create the **HTML** Files that are going to act like out **templates**. Thes html files are stored within a directory named *templates*. This directory exists in the same folder as the *app.py* file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Templates created\n",
    "I have created 2 templates initially. One is the default page, the other is the registration page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline\n",
    "Then we will have to construct a pipeline so that we may take the input from the user and store it in a file locally. For this purpose, we will have set route in the *app.py* file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, basically, here is how we are going to contruct the pipeline:\n",
    "1. Fetch the details from the **Client Side**.\n",
    "2. Set route via Flask.\n",
    "3. Store it into the JSON File.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">Mention that there are two methods for fetching the data from the client side, that are get and post methods. Mention how these work.<br>\n",
    "GET Method: <br>\n",
    "Mention what is the role of a url in the get method. Explain what are the uses and why GET method is preferable in some cases.<br>\n",
    "POST Method:<br>\n",
    "Mention how this is used to fetch the data and that this is used in terms of fetching more sensitive informations such as personal info, passwords, credit card details, etc. Explain what are the uses and why POST method is preferable in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario, we will be using the POST method, because we will be fetching confidential information such as email, password, etc. Here's how its happening in the code:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "    <form action=\"/perform_registration\" method=\"post\">\n",
    "        <label>Name</label><br>\n",
    "        <input type=\"text\" name=\"user_name\"><br>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we have set the form method to `post`, and upon submitting the form, the user will be taken to the route */perform_registration*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given below is the `perform_registration` **function**, which our route */perform_registration* leads to (of course this function is defined within the *app.py* file).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from db import Database\n",
    "\n",
    "dbo = Database()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/perform_registration\", methods=[\"post\"])\n",
    "def perform_registration():\n",
    "    name = request.form.get(\"user_name\")\n",
    "    email = request.form.get(\"user_email\")\n",
    "    password = request.form.get(\"user_password\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    response = dbo.insert(name, email, password)\n",
    "\n",
    "    if response:\n",
    "        return \"Registration Successful\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Email already exists\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we import the class `Database` from the file we manually created, `db.py`. We are assigning `Database()` class a variable, that is `dbo`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then fetch the `name`, `email`, and `password` from the form, pass them to the `insert()` function from the `Database` class. If the insert function successfully runs, we get and output saying **\"Registration Successful\"**, else, saying **\"Email already exists\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code given inside the `db.py` file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json, os\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Database:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        if not os.path.exists(\"users.json\"):\n",
    "            with open(\"users.json\", \"w\") as wf:\n",
    "                json.dump({}, wf)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def insert(self, name, email, password):\n",
    "        with open(\"users.json\", \"r\") as rf:\n",
    "            users = json.load(rf)\n",
    "\n",
    "        if email in users:\n",
    "            return ()\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            users[email] = [name, password]\n",
    "\n",
    "        with open(\"users.json\", \"w\") as wf:\n",
    "            json.dump(users, wf, indent=4)\n",
    "            return 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Leaving the explanation of this file's code as it is pretty explanatory itself."
