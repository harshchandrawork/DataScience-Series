    "\n",
    "## 🔹 What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.\n",
    "* It is a **set of rules and protocols** that allows two different software systems to communicate with each other.\n",
    "* You can think of it as a **data pipeline** between applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 How Does an API Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "* APIs act as a **bridge**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **client** (user, web app, or mobile app) sends a **request**.\n",
    "  * The **server** (API provider) receives the request, processes it (using functions, services, or databases).\n",
    "  * The server sends back a **response** (usually in **JSON** format).\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 JSON (**JavaScript Object Notation**) is widely used because it is lightweight, human-readable, and easy to parse in different programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Importance of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integration**: Enables software to use each other’s services (e.g., Google Maps API, Twitter API).\n",
    "* **Automation**: Tasks can be automated by calling APIs instead of doing them manually.\n",
    "* **Data Access**: Provides controlled access to data stored in databases.\n",
    "* **Scalability**: Businesses can expand services without rebuilding entire systems.\n",
    "* **Reusability**: Same API can be used across mobile apps, web apps, and third-party systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Real-Time Uses of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Websites & Apps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Payment gateways (Razorpay, PayPal APIs).\n",
    "  * Weather apps using weather data APIs.\n",
    "  * E-commerce sites showing live product stock via APIs.\n",
    "  * Social media logins (Google, Facebook OAuth APIs).\n",
    "* **Data Science**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pulling data from APIs (e.g., stock market data, COVID data).\n",
    "  * Sending ML model predictions as an API service for apps to consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 API Workflow (How It Enables Input → Processing → Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: User sends data (e.g., city name) via an API request.\n",
    "2. **Processing**: API calls a function or interacts with a **database**.\n",
    "3. **Output**: API sends back the result (e.g., weather info) in **JSON format**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **banking API** lets apps check account balance or transfer money securely.\n",
    "  * A **Google Maps API** allows developers to embed maps without storing huge datasets.\n",
    "* In Data Science, APIs allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Fetch **data from databases**.\n",
    "  * Expose **ML models** as services for real-world usage.\n",
